Automated copy trading bot for Hyperliquid DEX. Copies trades from any wallet in real-time with automatic position sizing.

## Features

- Real-time trade copying via WebSocket
- Automatic position sizing based on account balance ratio
- Integer leverage with asset-specific limits
- Market and limit order support
- Copy existing positions on startup
- Simulated trading mode for testing
- Telegram notifications (optional)

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Installation

1. Install Python 3.12+
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure .env file with your settings
4. Run the bot:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file:

```properties
# Target wallet to copy
TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...

# Your Hyperliquid credentials (leave empty for simulation)
HYPERLIQUID_WALLET_ADDRESS=
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Trading mode
SIMULATED_TRADING=true
SIMULATED_ACCOUNT_BALANCE=10000.0

# Copy settings
COPY_OPEN_POSITIONS=true
LEVERAGE_ADJUSTMENT=1.0
USE_LIMIT_ORDERS=false

# Asset Filters
BLOCKED_ASSETS=BTC,ETH  # Comma-separated list (e.g., BTC,ETH,SOL)

# Telegram (optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=
```

## Leverage Adjustment

The `LEVERAGE_ADJUSTMENT` setting controls risk:

- 0.5 = Use 50% of target's leverage (safer)
- 1.0 = Match target's leverage exactly
- 2.0 = Use 200% of target's leverage (more aggressive)

Leverage is automatically rounded to integers and capped at asset-specific maximums.

## Blocked Assets

The `BLOCKED_ASSETS` setting lets you exclude specific assets from copying:

```properties
BLOCKED_ASSETS=BTC,ETH,SOL
```

When the target wallet trades these assets, the bot will:

- Log a warning message
- Skip copying the trade
- Continue monitoring other assets normally

This is useful for:

- Avoiding high-volatility assets
- Excluding assets you're manually trading
- Managing risk by limiting exposure to certain markets

Note: Asset symbols are case-insensitive (BTC, btc, Btc all work).

## Position Sizing

Position sizes are automatically calculated based on the ratio of your account balance to the target wallet balance.

Example:

- Target wallet: $100,000
- Your account: $10,000
- Ratio: 1:10
- Target opens 1 BTC position = You open 0.1 BTC position

## Docker Commands

### Windows

```cmd
